# dad's old HiFi Separates

I've taken custody of dad's old HiFI separates while mum replaces some carpet.

I mean to check the HiFi works, clean it all up and return it when mum's place is ready.  

# Amplifier  
Had it's metal lid off for better ventilation, because it was installed in a wooden cabinet. Luckily things like that were never thrown away so I've reunited the amp with it's metal shell.  

I carefully vacuumed dust out of the amp (not much considering how long it had been topless) and screwed the top of the metal cabinet back on. It had a bit of a scratch, but you'd hardly know it.  

# Tape  
The flex had a [shattered plug](shattered%20plug.md).  

# CD  
CD drawer had **The Best Of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky** *(Telstar 1991)* in it. I gave all 6 tracks a spin.  
All total bangers.  


# Turntable  
Bearing mount for turntable has cracked off its mounting.
