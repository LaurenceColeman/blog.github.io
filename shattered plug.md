# shattered plug

The three pin plug on [[dad's old HiFi Separates]] tape deck was shattered some time in the past and is unusable.  
It's not just unsafe, it's missing a pin.
- I borrowed the plug off a florescent tube I haven't used for a while.
- I [fitted the plug](fit%20a%20plug.md) to the tape-deck.
- A few days later, I've replaced the missing plug with one from the supermarket.
- It came with a 13amp fuse which seemed like overkill, so I replaced it with a 3amp.
