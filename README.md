# blog  

I will write and share records of my projects.  
By reflecting and writing up my thoughts, I mean to crystallize the experience into lessons learned.  
For the most part, the log is just for myself. But this repo is public and written to be useful.  
It's not meant to be popular.   
But if you can get use from it, then please do.  

Each document is hyperlinked to related content in the repo and other content elsewhere.
